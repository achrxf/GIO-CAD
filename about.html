            <h4>Our Story</h4>
        </div>
        <p>GIO CAD traces its roots to the classrooms where three friends discovered their shared passion for CNC machining and the transformative world of Computer-Aided Design (CAD). From these formative experiences emerged a vision: to create a company that would redefine the boundaries of CAD services.
            Driven by their collective curiosity and the boundless potential they saw in CAD, these friends embarked on a journey to turn their classroom learnings into something meaningful. United by a shared zeal for innovation, GIO CAD was born—an embodiment of their commitment to converting dreams into tangible designs.</p>
